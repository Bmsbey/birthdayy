    <h1>To My Love</h1>
    <p>There has been a man called Burak. He is an engineer and interested in history. In a day, Burak has seen a beautiful girl.When he has seen this girl, he has thought I think I‚Äôm met with this girl before I was born when I was an only soul. After this day, many days have passed but Burak cannot reach this adorable girl. However, he has been researching this girl because he both saw her heavenly face and heard her wonderful voice. After many weeks and months, while Burak was reading a book, he has slept. When he has waked up, he has noticed that there is a weird situation. After he walked around the city where he has lived nowadays, he has reached a bazaar. He has wanted to look around the bazaar and entered. When he has been walking around the bazaar, he heard a voice. At the first time, he couldn‚Äôt believe this voice because this voice is hers. He has not thought  this is a dream and since he has falled love in this girl, he was hearding her voice. However, he couldn‚Äôt stand and has wanted to look at the owner of the this excellent voice. When he looked this girl‚Äôs face, he was shocked because this girl is her. He was sure anymore because such a beauty could not be a deception of a dream. He has finally found her. He has gone to near of this girl without waiting anything because he had losted this girl for a time and he has never wanted to lost her again. He went to her nearside and said that hi I want to meet you because it might be weird for you but I know you although we never meet with you. I can say I know you even before when I was born. She also has been shocked because someone has come her nearside and was saying something about her. She has thought it is really weird. However, Burak has started to explain his feeling for her. Even though they were not as beautiful as the girl's face, they were beautiful words. Actually, Burak has wanted to get her phone number but there is an issue. They have been in the past and phone has not been invented yet. When he has asked her to learn how they can meet again, she said that if you come in front of this blue home at noon for everyday, you can see me. After Burak has gone to the place where he waked up, he has slept. When he wake up, he noticed that he has come his original date. After he noticed, he has become extremely upset because he had found his incredible love but she was in the past. Again days have passed but he was still disappointed because he could not find his love.
In a day, he was walking aimlessly and he has noticed something interesting and this situation make him shocked because he has found the blue home which his source of beauty love said to meet by chance. After he saw this home, he has started to wait his love. After a few hours, he has seen her. He felt like he couldn't breathe and time had stopped. He finally has found her. At that moment, she was smiling to him. Both of two have started to run to each other. When their distances between them has finished, they had only a chance to do. They hug. After hugging for a long time, they have started to talk at the same time. Actually, like Burak, Zehra also has seen the same dream at the same time and she has gone to in front of the blue home everyday after the dream. They were falling love to each other. They lived together forever and they had had 2 children. We know one of them is definitely a girl called Ada but we do not know still what is the other child‚Äôs gender and name. What we said, they have had their happy days, let‚Äôs be on our way.  Dear my princess, the worlds can change but you should never forget I love you in all worlds, in all conditions. Have a nice birthday. I hope we will celebrate minumum 70 your birthday ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüòòüòòüòòüòòüòò</p>
